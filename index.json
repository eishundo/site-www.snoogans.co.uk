As far as I could tell the levels were split up into missions, with 11 levels per mission. The final level of a mission being extremely large and introducing some real bad ass monsters.\nI managed to reach the last level of mission 2 (22 planets) - some people played as far as mission 91 (WOW! That\u0026rsquo;s 1001 planets). I made a note of all the pass codes, and collected screen grabs of all the weapons and robot parts.\nI recently came across all my notes on my old Amiga and wondered how much interest a Web page would receive. If you played Captive or managed to get further than I, send me an email.\nDownload the music from Captive (Amiga) (MOD format) FAQ Was Captive ever released on the PC? Yes, it even has an animated introduction and music. Thanks to Jehan de Béthune-Sully who made me aware of it\u0026rsquo;s release. His site is no longer available, but was \u0026ldquo;Belgian Dungeon Keeper\u0026rdquo; (homeusers.brutele.be/jehan/). You should be able to download the PC DOS version here:\nAbandonware DOS oldgames.sk BestOldGames.net Also you can get an Amiga emulator for your PC.\nWhere can I get this emulator? Try:\nWinUAE Official Homesite RetroArch with PUAE AmigaInABox Where can I download the game and kickstart ROMs? There are a few ways to obtain Amiga Kickstart ROMs, hunt them down yourself online, or the easy (and official/legal) way, by purchasing them as part of the Amiga Forever package.\nFor more information, see:\nAmiga ROMs How To Retro - Where To Get Amiga Kickstart ROMs Can I use my old Captive save disk? From Sean Donohue:\nIt is possible. You need an original captive game and an amiga 1200 with hard drive. You need to install whdload on the Amiga\u0026rsquo;s hard drive. Using your PC, download the whdload package specially designed for Captive . Install that on the Amiga. It will ask you to insert the Captive game disk and it will install that on the hard drive, then it will ask for the Captive game save disk. Once you have installed the game and save disk to the hard drive, all you have to do is find were it is installed on the Amiga and transfer it to the PC. On the PC emulater side, you have to install whdload. Then pass the Captive installation from the Amiga hard drive to the WinUAE folder.\n— Sean Donohue\nI\u0026rsquo;m stuck on Mission 2, Level 2 (Phoopel). I can\u0026rsquo;t find code 15099. A - A possible bug.\nQ - I\u0026rsquo;m stuck on Level 7 (Phelphio), Mission 11. I can\u0026rsquo;t find code 3673. A - Yet another bug.\nHere is Michaël Châteauneuf\u0026rsquo;s description of the missing clipboard problems:\nMission 2, Level 2: Phoopel The clipboard is on the floor, but invisible. Be in front of the cupboard 15099 then turn left, go forward one step, turn left again and go forward one step again. Now, click on the floor at the left side to pick up the clipboard.\nMission 11 - Level 7: Phelphio The clipboard is at the same place where the wall that is supposed to open using that code on the clipboard. Because there\u0026rsquo;s an object on the floor at the same place of a wall, the clipboard seems to be invisible.\nUnder PC, the clipboard appears normally in the wall using the Vision Corrector. Also, when activating the code to open/close the wall, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because we close a fake wall. If you put an object at the same place, the object may disappear, but it is still there.\nClipboard solution generator Now, how about this for an amazing discovery.\nPenny Ford emailed me in June 2004 with a fantastic C program that can generate the bar style clipboard solution when given the mission, level and code number.\nUnfortunately, I somehow let this slip through the net and forgot about it until over a year later. I then took upon the task of tracking down the author of this neat program and decided to convert it into a web enabled JavaScript App (and a Perl script too).\nIt turns out the original C program was written by Laurent de Soras and can be found here . Luckily he released it under the GNU GPL, so I have been able to provide a JavaScript version below.\nYou can download the source code for the original C program along with my Perl and JavaScript versions here .\nNote: You must have JavaScript enabled\nEnter Mission (1 = first one, max = 6000) Enter Level (0 = first one, max = 10) Enter Code Robotics and Weapon Skills The images below were ripped from the Amiga game using an Action Replay cartridge and edited using DPaint III.

II Root Finder Guides you the quickest route out of the base when the generators have blown. Can also give you the direction of the base when you are outside, or the direction of your lander module if there\u0026rsquo;s no base (or if it has been destroyed) III Mapper Maps the areas you have covered. Shops are shown in red, ladders in white, holes in green and doors in yellow. You can also mark important areas on the map. IV Radar Scan your immediate vicinity for an enemy presence. V Magna Scan Just a compass (look at the dots: they always go towards the north). VI Body Scan Useful for quick damage updates. When a portion of your robot becomes damaged it will highlight the specific area. Repairs up to 10%. VII Vision Correction Resets your eyes to 20/20 vision. It also shows you hidden rooms (removes false walls). Clears the static interference if you bump into fire. Super Visor Gives you infra-red vision so you can see in the dark. Clears the static interference if you bump into fire. Dev-Scapes Grade Dev-Scape Description Basic Anti-Grav Allows you to walk on the ceiling, fight with floating monsters, go over water and enter holes in the ceiling. II Shield Provides minimal protection from alien attacks by reducing the amount of damage you receive. III Fire Shield You receive far fewer damage points from alien flame throwers. IV Greaser Enables you to run faster. V Power Zapper It zaps your power \u0026hellip; USELESS\u0026hellip; However, according Norma Wrangham, the Power Zapper was not as useless as everyone thinks. It had one very useful, if not vital, use. If you lost all power and bought a battery to power up and get out of trouble, the battery sometimes loaded in so fast that it overshot and emptied again, leaving you still powerless and out of money. By running the Power Zapper Devscape 5 simultaneously with the battery charging, power loaded in slowly and you received the full battery power that you had paid for. VI Fixer Fixes body parts at 0%, but does not give a full repair. VII Re-charger Give this to your team leader, so his power will stop dropping. No need for power sockets anymore. Super Deflector Deflects any enemy fire. They drain very quickly and are very expensive. Thanks to Katz for help with the Optics and Dev-Scapes information.\nIdeal droid names Norma Wrangham worked out the ideal droid names to achieve the highest stats at character generation time:\n[Do not] start with poorly named droids as their initial power is a result of the letters in their names. Never use a name resulting in any of the three numbers for dexterity, vitality and wisdom being in single figures and get as near to the maximum 15 value as possible for each if you want them to gain power fast. They never really catch up with bad names. After much experimenting, in increasing order of power, the best names I found were:\n10, 15, 15 - Sally Plod, Alison 11, 15, 15 - Woopsie Bear, West 14, 15, 15 - Zak, Alphonsus. Unfortunately the only 15, 15, 15 I was able to find was Lambkin, no name for a tough leader, but my leaders seemed able to live it down and keep the respect of their team!\n— Norma Wrangham\nThanks for the info Norma\nMission 1 notes Planet Level Name Main Door Combination Computer Codes New Monsters Super Buys Security Codes 1 0 Butre TL, BL, TR, BR Chaeselume Trifids, Elves \u0026amp; Mad Professor Battle-Gloves 2 1 Pelphi BR, BL, TL, TR Ruppesicbery Mummies \u0026amp; Track Robots Tindron \u0026amp; Fire-Axe 3 2 Meestre TL, TR, BL, BR Phyderlaps \u0026amp; Exsomided Whirlmen, Critters, Mini Robots, Two Headed Dogs, Guards Scooofar, Ruppekal \u0026amp; Eginham 4 3 Triekos TR, BR, BL, TL Ratsicpocy \u0026amp; Elsisydon Sentry Droids, Ceiling Robots, Light Sabre Monsters \u0026amp; Fire Demons Magnums, Hunters \u0026amp; Coppator Pocinsbee, Elders, Yulthaape, Viginink \u0026amp; Chaltedon 5 4 Salstee TR, BR, BL, TL Sythalebee \u0026amp; Midinsneing Tanks \u0026amp; Red Soldiers -ALL PREVIOUS- Lapcepy, Phydered \u0026amp; Exsosy 6 5 Seavy BR, TL, BL, TR Yulesdeape \u0026amp; Pocceplapls Trolls, Acid T.V\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; Speedo Ships Epeton, Sylekal \u0026amp; Rupsoham 7 6 Sodpia TR, BL, TL, BR Scosinsink Gun Emplacements, Fire Dragons \u0026amp; Gravity Droids Chasbee, Elsidon, Vipeape, Pocginkal, Yulooham, Exthafar \u0026amp; Ratsics 8 7 Quoonel TR, BR, TL, BL Laplelebee \u0026amp; Quesosifar Super Tanks \u0026amp; Floating Orbs -ALL PREVIOUS- Boosters \u0026amp; Ironide Syinsink, Lapdering, Yulenebery, Midesdon, Physiy, Queltes \u0026amp; Exneed More pass codes coming soon.\nCaptive Leader Board Player Mission Planet Version Jim Adcox\u0026rsquo;s roommate 91 1001 Amiga Jim Adcox 67 737 Amiga Jim Adcox 67 737 Amiga Jeffrey Lane 28 306 Atari ST Michael C 3 135 PC Doug Yanega 11 117 Atari ST James Crawford 11 117 Amiga Chris Pile 2 22 Amiga Think you deserve to be on the Captive Leader Board?

This hosting company is run by a few ex-colleagues from Netscalibur.\nThe server was located at Telehouse in London, Docklands.\nHaving worked at an ISP for the previous 5 years, I put all my knowledge to use and basically ran my own mini-ISP on this server.\nServices installed, configured and managed by myself:\nOS FreeBSD. RAID 1 (disk mirror) using the GEOM framework via the gmirror(8) command. Monitoring/alerting Nagios. DNS BIND 9. Primary DNS for snoogans.co.uk. Base services OpenSSL to generate and manage my own CA and SSL certificates. OpenLDAP. BerkleyDB backend for OpenLDAP. pam_ldap for authentication using OpenLDAP. Statistics/logging Cricket , RRDtool and Mailgraph for stats graphing. Cronolog for managing Apache logs. AWStats and Webalizer for generating Apache visitor statistics.

Cyrus SASL to integrate IMAP/POP3 authentication with the accounts in OpenLDAP. Amavisd-new, ClamAV and SpamAssassin to integrate anti-virus and anti-SPAM with the mail system. horde/imp/turba/passwd - PHP framework to deploy my own webmail system. phpldapadmin to manage the LDAP database entries. Instant Messaging jabberd14 IM server. msn-transport for jabber. This allowed Jabber clients to communicate with people using MSN Messenger. I learnt a LOT whilst managing all this, but needless to say, it took a serious amount of time and effort.\n2011-2016 Exonetric - Virtual server hosting s2.snoogans.co.uk Around 2010 I came to the conclusion that it takes up too much time to basically run your own mini-ISP. I was also worried that my ageing 1U server would experience a hardware failure. This is not something I wanted to experience.\nAround early 2010 I moved my mail hosting to GMail and moved my DNS hosting to another service provider.\nTo reduce monthly costs and not have to worry about supporting hardware, I switched from a physically hosted server to running snoogans.co.uk inside a FreeBSD container/ jail . Again, hosted with Exonetric .\nAt this point, I was only managing the web server setup.\n2016-2022 GoDaddy - Virtual server hosting s4.snoogans.co.uk to s6.snoogans.co.uk After many years running my own server and software, I decided to make life easier for myself and move to a fully hosted platform.
