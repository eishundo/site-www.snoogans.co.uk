      <description>Introduction: When moving from the beginner method to CFOP, I found it overwhelming to learn all the new 2-Look OLL and PLL algorithms.
I discovered that it is possible to reduce the number of 2-Look OLL and PLL algorithms you need to use in order to solve the cube whilst still using the CFOP method.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have a semi-decent speed cube, something like the MoYu RS3M 2020 1 as pictured above, will make cubing so much more enjoyable.</description>

      <description>Captive game design, programming and graphics by Antony Crowther.
Introduction: The futuristic Dungeon Master in space, with robots and lasers.
When Captive was originally released on the Amiga in 1990 I spent a good deal of my leisure time ploughing through it&amp;rsquo;s alleged 65,536 levels. As far as I could tell the levels were split up into missions, with 11 levels per mission. The final level of a mission being extremely large and introducing some real bad ass monsters.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I have hosted snoogans.co.uk for many years. The website frontend content is very minimal, but I enjoy learning about and configuring the backend.
2002-2004 Netscalibur - Physical server hosting jay.snoogans.co.uk I built this server using old server parts collected whilst working at the ISP, Netscalibur. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the original rear IO plate so made one out of a plastic ice cream container. There were no consumer 3D printers back in 2002.</description>
